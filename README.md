# TODO list app

This is a simple project using React Native and Expo, to practice some basic concepts.

## Functionalities

- Add a new task
- Mark a task as done
- Remove a task
- Show progress (amounts of total and completed tasks)
- Store to-do list to keep data on device

## Requirements

- NodeJS 18 (https://nodejs.org/en)
- Yarn (https://yarnpkg.com/) (recommended)

## Instructions

1. Clone the project to a local folder.
2. Run `yarn` to install dependencies (if you like to use npm, delete the yarn.lock file first and run `npm install`).
3. Start the app by executing `yarn start` (or `npm start` if you decide to use npm).
4. From the menu, select "a" to open an android simulator (require Android Studio installed), "i" for iOS simulator (require XCode installed, only with an Apple PC), or you can install Expo Go (https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/expo-go/) on your device and use it to scan the QR code available in the menu (so you can run and test the app directly on your device).
